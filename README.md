# MATLAB-Regression-Lines

Hello! I will be introducing basic formulaic expressions and how to create a least squares regression line in MATLAB.

First off, the data set that we would be using is included in this repository so please download that plus the MATLAB software. If you are a Boston College student then please use this link: https://bcservices.bc.edu/service/matlab and create an account with your BC email.

Great now let's open up MATLAB and create a new script. This new script will be what we will use to input in all of our data, create variables, and calculate the least squares regression line.

Now we can first input the data by putting it into quotes like shown below and we can assign it into a variable. Let's also create a variable for the types of data we want to create a least squares regression line for: time and air temperature. 

Now that the variables are created we can now use the least squares regression line
